# SeleniumProject1(Hybrid Driven FrameWork)
Its Automation Project using Selenium Hybrid Driven Framework.
Using this Framework i am testing the Amazon application.



here i have Stored all data and keywords(WebElements) in a 
seperate propetries file.


and i hava written the code in java
if any of the data or WebElements changed or modified no need
to change the code the code will run fine but u should only 
change the data in the properties file.
