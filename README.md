# SeleniumProject1(Hybrid Driven FrameWork)
Its Automation Project using Selenium Hybrid Driven Framework.Using this Framework i am testing the
Amazon application.Here i have Stored all data and keywords(WebElements) in a seperate propetries file.
I hava written the code in java if any of the data or WebElements changed or modified no need
to change the code the code will run fine but u should only change the data in the properties file.

Using this Framework i am testing the Amazon application.Here it performs login by sending the required
data to the respective text boxes and after login it performs searching for the items and adding it to
the cart.It performs all mouse events, clicking checkbox,radio buttons ,switching between the windows,
switching between the Frames etc.... And finally it performs signOut activity.
